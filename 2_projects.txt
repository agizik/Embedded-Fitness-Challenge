embedded_fitness_alpha is the project I worked on during observing exercise logs and completed the project on this one
you can follow my progress and tests, this one works amazing but the code is a mess.

embedded_fitness_betha is way easier to understand what I have done. Since I do not read roll and pitch in this 
version sampling frequency dramatically changed so I will do some more exercises to change some of the condition 
variables to make it work better.
